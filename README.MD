# Google Photos Panel
This is a small extension for Photoshop that i created in my freetime, it allows you to browse images you have uploaded to Google Photos.

While it does support drag and drop functionality (for uploading images) it does not work directly from Photoshop but rather from the Finder(Mac) or the File Explorer(Windows).
I might add support for this in the future as well as making it possible to open images from Google Photos in Photoshop from the extension.

## Downloads
Downloads are for the moment located here on Github: https://github.com/Hennamann/Google-Photos-Photoshop-Panel/releases and on my personal website: http://www.henrikstabell.com/.
The extension has been submitted to the Adobe Add-Ons store but it will take a few weeks before i get a reply on wether the extension is accepted or not.


Feel free to suggest ideas and commit pull requests with improvements and new features!
