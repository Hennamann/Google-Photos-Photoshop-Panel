# Google Photos Panel
This is a small extension for Photoshop that i created in my freetime, it allows you to browse images you have uploaded to Google Photos.

While it does support drag and drop functionality (for uploading images) it does not work directly from Photoshop but rather from the Finder(Mac) or the File Explorer(Windows).
I might add support for this in the future as well as making it possible to open images from Google Photos in Photoshop from the extension.
